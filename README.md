## How is this data prepared?
* Data is stored and can be found on [Kaggle:Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).
* Data is organized both in wide and narrow format to allow for a more thorough analysis.
* It's determined that this data source is not ideal through ROCCC:
* ***Reliable***- data is not reliable as there is only 30 participants. The 30 participants does not represent the entire Bellabeat users so as a result, data can be biased. 
* ***Original***- data came from Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
* ***Comprehensive***-data was measured in variables needed for proper analysis. 
* ***Current***-data was collected 03-12-2016 to 05-12-2016 (5 years old), and it has not been updated since. 
* ***Cited***- data is from a third party so credibility is not known. 
## What is the process?
